# Bathymetry data processing
This script gets sonar data and water elevation data and returns
`*.csv` file with coordinates and bottom elevation.

Generally, this script gets water depths and water elevations, 
interpolates them spatially and temporally and converts every measured water depth
into bottom elevation.

# Project Goal
We tried to simplify processing of bathymetry data collected in tidal river
estuary.

Surveying river estuary we deployed several loggers measuring water elevation
along estuary. While loggers were working, we provided bathymetry observations
using sonar. Finally, we got sonar data (points with coordinates, depth and measurement time)
and logger data (temporal variation of water elevation along river esuary). 

As we wanted to automatically convert every observed depth into a bottom 
elevation, we made this program.
